Here you can find two notebooks that use the tools in `EFAS_hydro` to extract data from the Hydrological Data Collection Centre.

You can run those notebooks locally, if you have installed the library in your own environment, or run them virtually on Binder by clicking the ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg) logo on top of the notebooks. This second option will launch a notebook on a virtual server with all the necessary libraries.

[tutorial.ipynb](tutorial.ipynb) is a simple example that shows how to use the tools to extract the daily time series of Portuguese reservoirs. You can adapt the code to your needs.

[glofas_calibration.ipynb](glofas_calibration.ipynb) is an adaptation of the previous tutorial specific to the data required for the GloFAS calibration.
